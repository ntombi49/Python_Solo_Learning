# Lesson: Comments & Indentation
# 🗒️ 1. Comments

# Comments are lines that Python ignores — they’re meant for humans to read, not the computer.

# They help explain what your code does.

# 💬 Single-line comment
# Starts with #

# This prints a greeting
print("Hello, world!")

# 🧾 Multi-line comment

# You can use triple quotes (""" or ''') for longer notes.
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It’s useful when explaining a big section of code.
"""
print("Python is fun!")

# 📏 2. Indentation

# Indentation means spaces at the beginning of a line.
# Python uses indentation to define blocks of code — for example, inside loops, functions, or if-statements.

# Example:
if True:
    print("This line is indented correctly")
    print("It belongs to the if statement")
print("This line is outside the if statement")

# 💡 By default, use 4 spaces for indentation (VS Code does this automatically).

# ✅ Summary

# Use # for comments.

# Indentation defines structure in Python.

# Always be consistent — 4 spaces per level.
