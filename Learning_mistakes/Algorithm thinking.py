# You are great at writing code once you know the idea,
# but you struggle with:

# “How do I start?”

# “What’s the plan?”

# “How do I approach this problem?”

# 📘 What to learn next:
# Practice thinking in steps:

# Example: “remove vowels”

# create empty result

# loop over characters

# check if char is not a vowel

# add to the result

# return result
