# You sometimes confuse how each one works:

# set → removes duplicates but loses order

# list → ordered, can have duplicates

# string → cannot be changed directly

# 📘 What to learn next:
# When to use a list vs a set

# How to loop over them

# How to build a new string character by character

# List methods: .append(), .remove(), .sort(), .reverse()

# Set methods: set(), .add(), .union(), .intersection()
